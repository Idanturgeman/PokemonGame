This code showing how we can use a directed and weighted graph for a nice of pokemon game.
This project is continued of the **[shortestPathOnGraph](https://github.com/Idanturjeman/ShortedPathOnGraph)** project as i promised, 
Only this time the graph is directed and also we can see it visually.
The graph is calculated to perform in the best way as possible and for doing that it is used a BFS Dijkstra's algorithm.
Moreover the project have a test files for every class.

* Can calaulate **the shortest path** between 2 node **aka** source and destination.
* Calculation of graph that include up to **10 milons of nodes** in time up to **10 seconds!**



## Culculate the shortest path with Dijktra's algorithm
**see [Dijkstra's algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm) for more info.**

### Some [Directed Weighted Graph](https://github.com/Idanturjeman/PokemonGame/wiki/Directed-Weighted-Graph) visual example

### For installing the project 
Get this [Pokemon game project](https://github.com/Idanturjeman/PokemonGame) to your own computer with your workspace directory.
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/Idanturjeman/PackmanGame.git

```

### Prerequisite
* **[JDK](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html)**
* **[intllij](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)** or some other **IDE**

### Game's main idea
We got some [Agents](https://github.com/Idanturjeman/PokemonGame/wiki/Agents) on a [directed weighted graph](https://github.com/Idanturjeman/PokemonGame/wiki/Directed-Weighted-Graph), and our purpose is to catch the most of [Pokemons](https://github.com/Idanturjeman/PokemonGame/wiki/Pokemons) as we can that are on the same graph, and we trying to do that in the best efficient way with the lowest calls from [moves](https://github.com/Idanturjeman/PokemonGame/wiki/Move-Data). obviously we have some [Algorithms](https://github.com/Idanturjeman/PokemonGame/wiki/Algorithms) that helping us to do so. 



***Some examples of scenerios in the game***

* *scenario 0*: 
```sh
149 pkm, 57 moves.
```
* *scenario 1*:
```sh
580 pkm, 225 moves.
```
* *scenario 2*:
```sh
287 pkm, 75 moves.
```
* *scenario 3*:
```sh
936 pkm, 265 moves.
```
* *scenario 4*:
```sh
243 pkm, 62 moves.
```
* *scenario 5*:
```sh
583 pkm, 204 moves.
```
* *scenario 6*:

79 pkm, 28 moves.
```
* *scenario 7*:
```sh
412 pkm, 191 moves.
```
