# PokemonGame

This code showing how we can use a directed and weighted graph for a nice of packman game.
This project is continued to the shortestPathOnGraph project as i promised, 
Only this time the graph is directed and also we can see it visually.
The graph is calculated to perform in the best way as possible and for doing that it is used a BFS Dijkstra's algorithm.
Moreover the project have a test files for every class.

* Can calaulate **the shortest path** between 2 node **aka** source and destination.
* Calculation of graph that include up to **10 milons of nodes** in time up to **10 seconds!**

### For installing the project 
Get this [Pokemon game project](https://github.com/Idanturjeman/PokemonGame) to your own computer with your workspace directory.
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/Idanturjeman/PackmanGame.git

```

### Nedded for installing
* **[JDK](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html)**
* **[intllij](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) or some other IDE**

## Culculate the shortest path with Dijktra's algorithm
**see [Dijkstra's algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm) for more info.**

### Some [Directed Weighted Graph](https://github.com/Idanturjeman/PokemonGame/wiki/Directed-Weighted-Graph) visual example
